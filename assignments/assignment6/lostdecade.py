# The decade of the 2000s has been called the “lost decade” for the U.S. economy (Neil Irwin, “Aughts
# were a lost decade for U.S. economy, workers,” The Washington Post, 2 January 2010). We will take a
# look at the returns from investments in stocks and cash over this decade. You may use either R or a
# spreadsheet to do the following analysis.
# For the period from 2000-12-31 to 2010-12-31, form 11 portfolios of the two assets, R3000 and cash
# (proxied by T-bills), using constant weights, ranging from 100% cash/0% equities, to 0% cash/100%
# equities, in ten percent increments in weight. Assume the portfolios are rebalanced monthly to the fixed
# weights (ignore transaction costs). Calculate the monthly returns of the 11 portfolios.
# For each of the 11 portfolios, calculate the standard deviation of the returns, the arithmetic mean return,
# the geometric mean return, and the approximate geometric mean return using the equation given in
# Lecture 3. Plot the results on a graph (or on three graphs, if you wish), with the mean returns – arithmetic
# and geometric – on the vertical axis, and the standard deviation of returns on the horizontal axis.
# Comment on the accuracy of the approximate geometric mean return. Would an investment in any of the
# fixed mix strategies have resulted in greater ending wealth than an investment in cash or stocks alone
# over the decade? Write up your analysis in a document and submit.
